        <p>
          After Deng Xiaoping’s rise to power as the de facto leader of the Chinese Communist Party in 1978, 
          <span class="fn-text">China experienced substantial economic reforms that led to prosperity.</span><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> 
          The country saw an annual per capita GDP growth rate reaching 9 percent, and <span class="fn-text">many rural provinces 
            became quickly industrialized.</span>
          <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> 
          These reforms were not solely economic, however, as 
          <span class="fn-text">many of these directives were also set to decentralize the government, decollectivize agriculture, privatize state enterprises,
        and gradually move towards a market economy.</span><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>
          These reforms became the underpinning of China’s rise to the international stage as a major economic and political superpower; 
         <span class="fn-text">however, this rapid acceleration to power has also been met with parallel rises in divisions, 
          inequalities, and regionalism between China’s provinces.</span> <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>
          The most significant disparities between provinces can be seen particularly in Special Economic Zones (or SEZs) set forth to promote 
         <span class="fn-text"> foreign commerce during the implementation of these reforms.</span><sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> 
          This paper will focus specifically on the zones of Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Shantou, and Shanghai, and more broadly, the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, Henan, Shanghai, and Beijing. 
          The disparities between these particular zones and provinces are not only economic, but also political, linguistic, structural, and social.
        </p>
     <p>Economic disparities between regions began to grow after the implementation of Deng Xiaoping’s string of reforms 
        in the late 1970s, particularly following policies to decentralize government and decollectivize agriculture. 
        Both of these initiatives 
        <span class="fn-text"> “...fueled an unprecedented period of growth that increased GDP per capita.”</span><sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> 
        However, they also intensified 
        existing political, economic, and structural disparities between rural and urban populations.<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup>  
    </p>

        <p>
          Since the implementation of Deng Xiaoping’s reforms, income inequality has grown immensely in China. Prior to 1978, income inequality as measured through the GINI coefficient was only 0.16; between 1980 and 2002, it rose from 0.3 to 0.55. This sharp increase has “rendered China among the most unequal countries in the world.”
          Income inequality between regions, particularly coastal versus inland regions, has only grown due to rapid industrialization in South China, as well as “differences in education and the skill premium” and “structural factors such as urbanization and population aging.” This inequality is a clear representation of regional disparities in China and how they continue to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of the reforms, China’s economy was still largely based on agriculture. A significant move by the government in the shift towards a capitalist economy was the decollectivization of agriculture.
          <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>
          This initiative set to divide control of farmland that was once farmed communally, in its place instituting a “reorganization of the internal management system of the communes through the introduction of the contract system.” Farmers were given official control of their own land in exchange for a government-contracted portion of their crops.
